If you want to modify the animation, you need the following packages: `blender`, `imagemagick`, `optipng`.

1. Open Blender and verify that the output is set to PNG and color is RGBA
2. Start animation rendering. Results placed in the `render` directory
3. Run `gen.sh` to generate theme files and gifs
